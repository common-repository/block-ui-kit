Block UI Kit for Gutenberg editor
== Description ==

Block UI Kit for Gutenberg block editor. Easily add bootstrap blocks to the Gutenberg WordPress editor. Available blocks: container, row, columns, jumbotron, blockquote, picture, display, lead, alert, buttons, linkbuttons and more.

I started developing this plugin for myself. I wanted an easy way to add basic bootstrap elements to my wordPress website. I am sure there are many developers like me who would like to do the same. 

The blocks can be over-ridden with your own css to match your designs. We have added multiple configurable options to choose from. Most of the bootstrap classes can be added using the inspector controls. 

Give this plugin a try and let me know if you have any suggestions/comments. 

If you like the plugin, please leave a review. I would really appreciate it.
